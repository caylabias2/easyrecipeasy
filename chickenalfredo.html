						<h3> Instructions </h3> <br>
						<ol>
							<li> A large pot of salted water should be brought to a boil. Then add the fettucine and cook until al dente according to package directions.
							Which is usually 10 minutes. Save 1/2 cup of the cooking water then drain completely. Place aside</li>
							<li> Season chicken breasts with the Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. </li>
							<li> Use a nonstick pan and heat the olive oil using medium-high heat. Swirl the pan to evenly distribute the oil and then add the chicken. 
							Leave the chicken undisturbed in the pan for 5-7 minutes or until the bottom is golden brown. Then flip, and let the other side cook for an additional 5-7 mintues.
							</li>
							<li> Move the chicken to a cutting board and let rest for 3 minutes. Cut it into 1/2 inch thick pieces. Cover with foil as you prepare the sauce. </li>
							<li> In the same pan that was used for the chicken add butter and cream and whisk until the butter melts.</li>
							<li> Add the minced garlic, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning. Whisk the ingredients together well until they become smooth.</li>
							<li> Stirring regularly, heat for 3â€“4 minutes at a medium simmer (do not boil) until it begins to thicken.</li>
							<li> Add in the parmesan cheese and stir until it's melted and sauce is smooth.</li>
							<li> When done preparing the sauce, take it off the heat and toss it with the cooked fettuccine noodles.</li>
							<li> Plate the pasta, sauce, and chicken. Top with parsley and more parmesan if needed.</li>
